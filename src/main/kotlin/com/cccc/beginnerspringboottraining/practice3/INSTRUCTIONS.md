# Practice 3

Pokemon Simple Restfull CRUD

### Information

The "domain" package contains main classes for create the crud: 
* the domain model to use
* The repository interface to implement.

The layers of this practice are based in hexagonal architecture.

### Goals

Implement a simple CRUD restfull API using "Pokemon" domain model and "PokemonRepository" interface.

NOTE:
* Create simple classes.
* Respect standard convention restful APIs.
* Implement a memory repository, not use local persistence.
* Create a controller test in order to check get, post, put and delete http methods.
* Avoid accomplishment between domain and infrastructure models
